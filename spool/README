What is the spool directory here for?

To allow extraprocess communication, create FIFO objects in this directory,
named and purposed as follows:

      FIFO Name            Information routed to the file
      - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
      access.fifo          Login / Logout notifications
      admin.fifo           All Admin-level log messages
      adminhelp.fifo       AdminHelp messages from the server
      attack.fifo          Any Attack actions on the server
      prayer.fifo          Pray messages from the server

Any FIFOs not created will be created as files and appended to by the game
server.  admin.fifo in particular has the potential to grow quite large.

To create all of these FIFOs at once, run the following command in the
spool/ directory:

   $ mkfifo {access,admin{,help},attack,prayer}.fifo

WARNING:
Since FIFOs are blocking when both ends are not capped, be certain to have
your utility handle the case of the FIFOs not being open for writing.  BYOND
has no idea what a pipe is, so it thinks that it's appending to a file when
writing to the FIFOs.
