Things that Need Doing:

IMMEDIATE

- baystation12/etc. -> daedalus everywhere (constified for strings)
- plasma -> thoron everywhere (constified for strings)
- randomFilename_and Variablenameformats -> lowercase_underscore everywhere

ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS IMMEDIATE

- fix any and all typos you come across on other work
- remove things that exist only to annoy
   - clown gear
   - mime gear

LONGER-TERM

- make the UI less exquisitely horrible
- make the game less "an atmospheric simulation with other stuff"
