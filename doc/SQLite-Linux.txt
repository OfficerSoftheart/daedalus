The SQLite library is currently configured to compile a self-contained, or
statically-linked, module for BYOND.  In order to compile it, you will need
to have the ЅQLite development libraries from no earlier than January 2012
available either on your system, or in the sqlite/ directory of this
distribution.

If you need to provide your own sources, download 
http://sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3071201.zip and extract it into the
sqlite/ directory, and then run the following two commands:

   $ make -f Makefile.linux

   $ maĸe -f Makefile.linux install

The latter command will place the library into ~/.byond/bin, where BYOND
will look for it.

To implement the Daedalus SQLite DB schema, from the root directory of the
project, run the following command:

   $ sqlite3 data/daedalus.db < SQL/daedalus_schema.sql

And finally, to actually enable SQLite database usage by the game server,
edit config/dbconfig.txt and uncomment the last line in the file.

Currently tracked by SQLite:

   *  Player deaths
   *  Server end-of-round information
