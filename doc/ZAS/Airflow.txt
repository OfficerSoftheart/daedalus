CONTAINS:
All AirflowX() procs, all Variable Setting Controls for airflow, save/load variable tweaks for airflow.

VARIABLES:

atom/movable/airflow_dest
	The destination turf of a flying object.

atom/movable/airflow_speed
	The speed (1-15) at which a flying object is traveling to airflow_dest. Decays over time.


OVERLOADABLE PROCS:

mob/airflow_stun()
	Contains checks for and results of being stunned by airflow.
	Called when airflow quantities exceed airflow_medium_pressure.
	RETURNS: Null

atom/movable/check_airflow_movable(n)
	Contains checks for moving any object due to airflow.
	n is the pressure that is flowing.
	RETURNS: 1 if the object moves under the air conditions, 0 if it stays put.

atom/movable/airflow_hit(atom/A)
	Contains results of hitting a solid object (A) due to airflow.
	A is the dense object hit.
	Use airflow_speed to determine how fast the projectile was going.


AUTOMATIC PROCS:

Airflow(zone/A, zone/B)
	Causes objects to fly along a pressure gradient.
	Called by zone updates. A and B are two connected zones.

AirflowSpace(zone/A)
	Causes objects to fly into space.
	Called by zone updates. A is a zone connected to space.

atom/movable/GotoAirflowDest(n)
atom/movable/RepelAirflowDest(n)
	Called by main airflow procs to cause the object to fly to or away from destination at speed n.
	Probably shouldn't call this directly unless you know what you're
	doing and have set airflow_dest. airflow_hit() will be called if the object collides with an obstacle.
